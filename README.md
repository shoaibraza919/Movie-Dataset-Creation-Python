## Movie-Dataset-Creation-Python
Welcome to my web scraping project, Movie-Dataset_Creation using BeautifulSoup Python. I have created my own dataset by scraping around 450 wikipedia pages of Disney movies.

### Setup
The file 'Dataset-Creation.ipynb' contains the whole code and the folder 'dataset' contains the final data in the form .csv, .json and .pickle.

### Background Information
Here I have tested my abilities for a wide range of Python & Data Analysis topics in this project. It includes:
* Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup Python
* Accessing data from an API using Requests library
* Extensive cleaning of data
* Pattern matching with regular expressions (Re library)
* Working with dates (datetime library)
* Saving & loading data with Pickle library
* Finally saving the whole dataset into a .csv file.
